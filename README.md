# Enhancing Retrieval with LangGraph
LangGraph is an open-source framework by LangChain designed for constructing advanced multi-agent workflows powered by large language models (LLMs). This notebook begins by exploring Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and demonstrating use cases that highlight how self-grading or self-reflection can improve retrieval accuracy. It then covers techniques for enhancing questions to optimize document search. Finally, LangGraph is used to implement Corrective RAG, refine queries, and perform web searches to produce more reliable results.
